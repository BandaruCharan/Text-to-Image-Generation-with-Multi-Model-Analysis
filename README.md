# Text-to-Image-Generation-with-Multi-Model-Analysis

# Objective
Building a comprehensive pipeline that generates images from text descriptions
using Stable Diffusion, analyzes them using CLIP, and performs instance
segmentation using Metaâ€™s Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The system
should work on either GPU or CPU environments.

# Model References & GitHub Link
# 1. Stable Diffusion: https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion
# 2. CLIP: https://github.com/openai/CLIP
# 3. Segment Anything Model 2: https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything


# 1. Model Setup
Set up the environment to work with all three models
Ensure compatibility with both GPU and CPU environments
Include clear setup instructions for both hardware options

# 2. Core Functionality (Required)
Implement the following pipeline: 
1. Text-to-Image Generation: Use Stable Diffusion to generate an image from a text description
2. Image Analysis: Apply CLIP to analyze the generated image
3. Instance Segmentation: Use SAM2 to identify and segment regions of interest (ROI)
